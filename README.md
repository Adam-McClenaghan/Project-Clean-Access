# Project-Clean-Access
Project Clean Access (https://www.dmf-lab.co.uk/project-clean-access) aims to create a means for people to return to the workplace in a post-lockdown, COVID-19 world. Using simple tools that are easy to manufacture, and taking advantage of what is commonly available in the workplace, a system is proposed that allows people to interact with doors, cupboards and other mechanisms with minimal contact to try and break transmission paths.

Please find various step and stl files within this project. We expect to be continuously adding to these as we move forward. If you have any ideas or suggestions, please make contact using the email address XXX.
